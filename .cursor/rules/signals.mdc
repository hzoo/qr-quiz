## signals usage
```ts
import { signal } from "@preact/signals-react";
const count = signal(0);

// access with .value, can be used in components
// think about splitting components to save re-renders
<button onClick={() => count.value++}>{count.value}</button>;
```

- there's no need to pass down a value as props in react components if it's a signal because the component itself can import that signal directly inside the component.

```diff 
import { scannerEnabled } from "./signals";
- <BarcodeScannerView enabled={scannerEnabled.value} />
- function BarcodeScannerView({ enabled }: { enabled: boolean}) {}
+ <BarcodeScannerView />
+ function BarcodeScannerView() {}
```
